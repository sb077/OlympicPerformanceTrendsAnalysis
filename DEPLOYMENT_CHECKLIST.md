- [x] `Olympic_Event_Results.csv`
- [x] `Olympic_Athlete_Biography.csv`
- [x] `Olympic_Medal_Tally_History.csv`

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository
```bash
# Ensure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Streamlit Cloud deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Streamlit Cloud Deployment
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New app"
4. Configure:
   - **Repository**: Your repository
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `app/app.py`
5. Click "Deploy!"

### 3. Post-Deployment Setup
After deployment, the app will be available at your Streamlit URL. First-time setup:
1. Click "Upload" button to load CSV data into database
2. Click "Run Preprocessing" to create analysis tables
3. Run individual hypotheses for analysis

## üîß Configuration Details

### App Path
- **Main file**: `app/app.py`
- **Requirements**: `app/requirements.txt`
- **Config**: `app/.streamlit/config.toml`

### Dependencies
All dependencies are pinned to specific versions:
- streamlit==1.28.0
- pandas==2.0.3
- numpy==1.24.3
- matplotlib==3.7.2
- seaborn==0.12.2
- scikit-learn==1.3.0
- xgboost==1.7.6
- tensorflow==2.13.0
- And others...

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Check `requirements.txt` has all needed packages
2. **File Not Found**: Verify CSV files are in `app/csv_files/`
3. **Database Issues**: App creates database automatically on first run
4. **Memory Issues**: Large datasets may need optimization

### Performance Notes
- SQLite database for data storage
- Initial data upload may take time
- Consider data caching for better performance

## üìä App Features
- Data upload and management
- Interactive table viewing and modification
- Four comprehensive Olympic trend analyses
- Real-time data processing and visualization
- Preprocessing pipeline for data preparation
